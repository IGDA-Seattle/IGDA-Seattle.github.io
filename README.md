This website was designed and built by [Constance Chen](https://www.constancechen.me) for IGDA Seattle, a local professional chapter for game developers in the Seattle area.

## Development

- Download or clone
- `npm install`
- `gulp`
    - **Don't** directly edit `style.min.css`, `script.min.js`, or any `.html` page in the root folder.
    - **Do** edit `.scss` files, `script.js`, or any `.html` & `.dust` template within the `/html` folder.
- `git commit` and `git push` to master to deploy the site.
